### Tasks:

* Write a letter to your local political representative about why you think research is important.

    * What do politicians care about? Use this context to empathise with them and deliver your message effectively.

* Send an email to an editor (or editorial board) of a 'closed access' journal in your field to start the OA conversation.

    * Is the journal OA already (or 'hybrid')? How much are APCs for it? Are there any cheaper alternatives they might not be aware of?

* Does your research institute have a magazine, forum, or newsletter? Write a letter/post for it in support of Open Science.

* Draft your own email template reply for requests to peer review about how you only review for OA journals.

    * Re-use/base it on ones out there already. What has worked or not worked so well in the past?

* Outline opportunity costs for your university administrators on role of Open Science in hiring, tenure and promotion guidelines.

    * Outline concrete solutions and benefits Open Science can deliver for current headaches university administrators may struggle with.

* Find your local Open Science advocacy group and volunteer for them!

    * Does one not exist yet? Why not start one! Local groups are a great way to meet like-minded individuals and work together.

    * Having a webpage like Meetup can help keep people engaged and aware of meetings.
